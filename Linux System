#Getting into it
• /bin - basic programs (ls, cd, cat, etc.)
• /sbin - system programs (fdisk, mkfs, sysctl, etc)
• /etc - configuration files
• /tmp - temporary files (typically deleted on boot)
• /usr/bin - applications (apt, ncat, nmap, etc.)
• /usr/share - application support and data files

Man - Manual
man passwd - manual for the password
man - k passwd - search for a keyword in all the man pages
man -k '^passwd$' - match the entire line
man 5 password - look at section 5 of the manual

Man Sections:
1- User Commands
2- Programming interfaces for kernel system calls
3- Programming interfaces to the C library
4- Special files such as device nodes and drivers
5- File formats
6- Games and amusements such as screen-savers
7- Miscellaneous
8- System administration commands

apropos - search man page descriptions for a possible keyword match
- equal to man -k

ls - list files
ls /etc/apache2 - list files in a specific directory
ls -a - list all files including hidden
ls -1 - one listing per line (good for automation)

cd - change directory
pwd - present working directory
mkdir - make directory

mkdir module one
ls
module     one (created 2 dirs)

rm -rf module/ one/
(removed 2 dirs)

mkdir "module one" (created 1 dir)

cd module\ one/ (moved to a dir with a space in the title)
~/notes/module one$

mkdir -p test/{recon,exploit,report}
(Created 3 directories in test/

ls -1 test/ 
exploit
recon
report

which - searches through the directories that are defined in the $PATH environment variable for a given file name

echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

locate - creates a database and searches from it
sudo updatedb
locate sbd.exe

find - complex but effective
sudo find / -name sbd*
we can search by file age, size, owner, file type, timestamp, permissions, and more

Services
starting-
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl start apache2

verify-
sudo ss -antlp | grep sshd
sudo ss -antlp | grep apache2

start on boot-
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl enable apache2

show all services-
systemctl list-unit-files

Installing Tools

apt update
apt upgrade (package)

apt show
searching- searches in the description not just name 
apt-cache search (pure-ftpd)

sudo apt install - installs package and dependencies
sudo apt remove - erases but leaves config files
sudo apt remove --purge - erases all related to package

dpkg - the default module apt uses to install packages
- WILL NOT install dependencies automaticly
manually install a package you have (.deb)
sudo dpkg -i (path)
